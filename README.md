# Prelude #
One day, a client approached you, who are a freelance engineer, asking you to deliver a piece of software to help them run the business efficiently. As a smart engineer you convincd them that it’s better that you bill them by the hour. They agreed but in return convinced you that you can’t bill him more than a certain number of hours. "Fine!" you thought.

The client’s IT dept. sends you a document which outlines the list of requirements in very good detail –strange, huh!? When asked "are there any more work packages in the queue?", the reply is always “not at the moment; this could well be the last one.” Also, according to them, the acceptance test will be done by one of the operational managers of the business who has absolutely zero IT background.

And so _Stockman_ was born! 

# About This Repo #
Years ago, I created _Stockman_ as a set of _work packages_ to help me learn a new platform or hone my skills on a platform I thought I knew.

The work packages are designed in a way that they start from simple (to get your warmed up) and progressively get more difficult, covering a wider range of topics.

It's been a long while since I last coded in OCaml and so this repository is the implementation of those work packages in OCaml.

## Versioning Scheme ##
The releases will be of the format `vX.0` where `X` denotes the work package `X` (not surprisingly!).

# Work Packages #
* (WIP) 1.0 (see `/docs/wp01.md`)
